	 * PLAN:
	 * 
	 * 1. Loop random iterations (Number of corners)
	 * 2. Generate two random coordinates between 0 and 400
	 * 3. If !cross an old line or lies on an old line or point (Determinant)
	 * 			- Create point  
	 * 			- Add to arraylist of points or lines
	 * 4. After last iteration -> close the polygon
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 5. Loop random iterations for polygon 2
	 * 6. Generate point. Same rules as above BUT also check if the new line crosses any line of polygon 1, if so, set crossing boolean to true.
	 * 7. After last iteration -> if crossing == false: Copy one point from polygon1 and make it the last part of polygon2.
	 * 8. Close the polygon
