/**
 * Project: Implementation of efficient Collision Detection Algorithm
 * 
 * Course: D7013E Computational Geometry
 * Author: Anders Ragnarsson
 * Email: andrag-0@student.ltu.se 
 * 
 * 1. Description of the algorithm
 * 
 * Input: the endpoints that make up the line segments of two polygons that may or may not overlap with eachother.
 * Output: A list of intersection points between the two polygons, if the polygons overlap.
 * Time constraints: as efficient as possible, no naive solution.
 * 
 * The algorithm is a line sweep solution where the sweep line moves down from the top along the y-axis. A status tree holds the line segments that the
 * sweep line crosses, but not the ones it has passed or not yet reached. In this way, only the segments within the status are compared. When the sweep line 
 * has passed the end of a segment, the segment is removed from the status tree and never again considered. 
 * The algorithm contains the following steps:
 * 
 * 		1.1. The endpoints of the polygons are sorted in a queue made up of a self-balancing binary search tree (BBST)
 * 
 * 		1.2. For each event point in the queue:
 * 
 * 			* If it is a lower event point:
 * 				Remove the segments from the status tree that ends in this lower point
 * 
 * 			* If it is an upper event point, but not an intersection point:
 * 				Insert all segments this point is an upper point to, into the status tree.
 * 				Check if the new segment(s) give raise to a future intersection. If yes - add it as a new event point to the queue
 * 
 *  		* If it is an intersection event point
 *  			Add the points coordinates as an intersection in the algorithm output list
 *  			Make sure that the segments that intersects switch places correctly in the status.
 *				Check if the switching places of segments give raise to a future intersection. If yes - add it as a new event point to the queue
 *		
 *		
 * 2. Description of the implemented solution
 * 		
 * 		2.1 Event flow
 * 		The user draws two overlapping polygons in the GUI. When executing the program these points are sent to the CollisionDetection class
 * 		that performs the algorithm through the following steps:
 * 		
 * 		1. The event points are sorted in a self-balancing binary search tree (BBST) in O(log(n)) time
 * 		2. The status tree is initialized, also a BBST
 * 		3. For each event point in the queue
 * 				- Call handleEventPoint(Endpoint p)
 * 				- See JavaDoc for the methods below for more details
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 		2.2 System Architecture
 * 		The solution is divided into three packages; main, datastructures and algorithm. 
 * 		 
 *  	 The algorithm package holds the algorithm implementation and all the logic. Edges and Endpoint classes are what the polygons are made of. 
 *  	They hold references to each other, what polygon they belong to, as well as math functions for deciding on which side of a line a point lies and so on. 
 *  	Endpoints keep track of which Edges they are upper and lower points to.
 *  
 *		 The datastructures package contains the binary searh trees used for the event queue and the status tree and the main package contains the
 *		GUI implementation. The reason why there are two BBST implementations in the datastructures package is because the AVLTree implementation was not good enough
 *		for use as a status tree, so it was replaced by a Java TreeSet for the status.
 * 
 * 
 * 	3. Time complexity
 * 		Both the event queue and the status tree are self-balancing binary search trees that ensures O(log n) for each insert, retrieve and 
 * 		delete operation. Only edges that contain the current y-coordinate of the sweep line can exist together in the status tree. 
 * 		For each arriving event point, the status tree is searched a (small) constant number of times, giving k * log(n) time per event point.
 * 		Having n end points gives k*n*log(n) + I * log(n) time for the entire algorithm, where I is the number of intersections. 
 * 
 * 
 * 3. User manual
 * 		- Paint two polygons in the GUI by clicking with the mouse for each point in the polygons. 
 * 		- Do not cross a polygon with itself.
 * 		- To make the last line segment in a polygon, press "Finish polygon" button. 
 * 		- When two polygons are made, click "Compute collision" to run the algorithm.
 * 		- For each new run, a file is saved with the latest input data. To use it, set the variable String "loadFile" in GUI to the name of the
 * 		file you want to run. The files are written to the src directory. To draw your own polygons, leave "loadFile" an empty string ""
 *
