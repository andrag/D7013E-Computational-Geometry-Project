/**
 * Project: Implementation of efficient Collision Detection Algorithm
 * 
 * Course: D7013E Computational Geometry
 * Author: Anders Ragnarsson
 * Email: andrag-0@student.ltu.se 
 * 
 * 1. Description of the algorithm
 * 
 * Input: the endpoints that make up the line segments of two polygons that may or may not overlap with eachother.
 * Output: A list of intersection points between the two polygons, if the polygons overlap.
 * Time constraints: as efficient as possible, no naive solution.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * The algorithm is a line sweep solution where the sweep line moves down from the top along the y-axis. A status tree holds the line segments that the
 * sweep line crosses, but not the ones it has passed or not yet reached. In this way, only the segments within the status are compared. When the sweep line 
 * has passed the end of a segment, it is removed from the status tree and never again considered. 
 * The algorithm contains the following steps:
 * 
 * 		1. The endpoints of the polygons are sorted in a queue made up of a self-balancing binary search tree (BBST) in n(log n) time.
 * 
 * 		2. For each event point in the queue:
 * 
 * 			2.1 If it is a lower event point:
 * 				Remove the segments from the status tree that ends in this lower point
 * 
 * 			2.2 If it is an upper event point:
 * 				Insert all segments this point is an upper point to, into the status tree.
 * 				Check if the new segment(s) give raise to a future intersection. If yes - add it as a new event point to the queue
 * 
 *  		2.3 If it is an intersection event point
 *  			Make sure that the segments that intersects switch places correctly in the status.
 *				Add the coordinates as an intersection in the output list		
 * 
 * 2. Description of the implemented solution
 * 		1. The user draws two polygons using the implemented GUI
 * 		2. 
 * 3. Time complexity

	/**
	 * Constructor: 1. Creates a sorted event queue from the two starting points of the polygons.
	 * 				2. Creates a status tree
	 * 				3. Runs handleEventPoint() and findNewEvent() for each event point in the queue
	 * 				4. Runs handleIntersection for each event point that is also an intersection between two segments
	 * 
	 * 					Data structures
	 * 						Both the event queue and the status tree are self-balancing binary search trees that
	 * 						ensures O(log n) for each insert, retrieve and delete operation.
	 * 					
	 * 					The sweep line 
	 * 						The event points in the event queue are sorted such that the points with largest Y coordinates are handled first. Making
	 * 						up a line sweep approach where the sweep line moves downwards along the y-axis.
	 * 						An event point can be the following:
	 * 							1. Upper point to one or two segments
	 * 							2. Lower point to one or two segments
	 * 							3. An intersection between two segments
	 * 							4. A combinations of all the above
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 					Time complexity
	 * 						As the sweep line moves downward the y axis, only edges that contain the current y-coordinate exist in the status tree. 
	 * 						For each arriving event point, the status tree is searched a (small) constant number of times, giving k * log(n) time per event point.
	 * 						Having n endpoints gives k*n*log(n) + I * log(n) time for the entire algorithm, where I is the number of intersections.
